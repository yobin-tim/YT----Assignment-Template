## YT----Assignment-Template

I often use Latex to type up my answers to listed assignments which require a ton of Math symbols. I wanted to share this template that I use often for those assignments. This repo contains the main .tex file with (hopefully) sufficient comments to you started too. 

I will periodicially update the document to include more mathematical symbols or expressions that are not as easy to find on the internet (to be fair, they are not that hard to find either) so that things are in the same place. StackExchange is a wonderful place to begin if you need specific help.

Please feel free to suggest or add content if you find any. Hope it helps!
